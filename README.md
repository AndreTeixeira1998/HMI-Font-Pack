About
-----

This HMI Font Pack contains a large selection of open-source fonts that can be used in Nextion / TJC HMI projects.
The Nextion Editor and TJC USART Editor use a propriatary .zi font format.
Now you can add a wide selection of quality fonts to your project in seconds.

In the font pack there are dozens of fonts for each supported language (codepage) in different fontsizes.
Only Regular styles are included in the current release.

The .zi files are version 5 and support anti-aliasing and variable width fonts. Version 0.55 or higher of the Nextion / USART HMI Editor is needed to use these font files.
